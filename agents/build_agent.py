─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Guided proposal builder — a streaming conversational agent that
walks an NGO through building a proposal from scratch.

Flow (7 guided steps):
  1. Project Vision      — what problem, who benefits, where
  2. Key Activities      — what you will actually do
  3. Target Beneficiaries — who and how many
  4. Org Capacity        — why your org is right for this
  5. Goals & KPIs        — measurable outcomes
  6. Budget Overview     — rough cost categories
  7. Sustainability      — life after grant funding

After each step, the agent drafts that section using the
existing draft_agent SECTION_PROMPT, giving the user real
proposal text they can edit and approve.

Streaming protocol (same as draft_proposal_stream):
  { "type": "question",  "step": 1, "key": "vision",    "text": "..." }
  { "type": "draft",     "step": 1, "key": "vision",    "title": "...", "content": "..." }
  { "type": "complete",  "proposal": { ... full proposal dict ... } }
